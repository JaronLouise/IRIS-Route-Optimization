## Getting Started 
1. Download the repository and unzip the files.
2. Don't forget to unzip the road data (.json) files.
3. The app is tested using live server extension in vs code.
<!-- Installation instructions will be addeed here later -->

## Usage
1. **Login** to the application using authorized credentials.
2. **Access the Campus Map**, which displays current emergency routes.
3. **Select a Destination** for emergency routing, and the application will calculate and display the optimal path using A* algorithm.
4. **Follow the Route Guidance** provided by the system to reach the destination quickly.

## Features
- **Emergency Route Optimization**: Calculates the shortest and fastest emergency response route based on A* algorithm.
- **Campus Map Integration**: Interactive, responsive map with real-time route updates.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login for authorized users.
- **Data Visualization**: Clear, accessible visuals for route navigation and algorithm progress.
