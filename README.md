# I.R.I.S. (Intelligent Route Identification System)

I.R.I.S. (Intelligent Route Identification System) is a web application designed to optimize emergency response routes within a university campus. By leveraging Dijkstra’s algorithm, the application identifies the fastest routes to emergency locations, enabling quicker response times and improved campus safety.

## Getting Started
<!-- Installation instructions will be addeed here later -->

## Usage
1. **Login** to the application using authorized credentials.
2. **Access the Campus Map**, which displays current emergency routes.
3. **Select a Destination** for emergency routing, and the application will calculate and display the optimal path using Dijkstra's algorithm.
4. **Follow the Route Guidance** provided by the system to reach the destination quickly.

## Features
- **Emergency Route Optimization**: Calculates the shortest and fastest emergency response route based on Dijkstra’s algorithm.
- **Campus Map Integration**: Interactive, responsive map with real-time route updates.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login for authorized users.
- **Data Visualization**: Clear, accessible visuals for route navigation and algorithm progress.
